# COVID-19 Sex
A project about the impact of COVID-19 on online social networking and sexual behaviors. A collaboration with Liam Wignall. 

Some of the data from a larger survey were published previously. The present project centers social isolation to focus on contact with a partner, online dating, the use of social networks, the consumption of pornography, sexual activities during lockdown, and sexual health practices.
